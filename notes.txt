To build a executable file that can run without Go installed on a machine,
run go mod init example.com/first-app. The path can be changed, in this example, the executable
file will be called first-app. 

This file can be executed by running ./first-app 

You can also run a file using go run . 

Then run go build, which'll generate the executable file.
